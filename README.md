## Senior Study Capstone Project Details

### Learning Outcomes
- Demonstrate the ability to program in a higher level language (write functions, utilize
control flow in a variety of languages and tools such as Python or R)
- Demonstrate the ability to think algorithmically
- Acquire, manage and manipulate data, including joining data from different sources and
formats and restructure data into a form suitable for analysis
- Develop the ability to build and assess data-based models
- Demonstrate an understanding of and ability to detect patterns in data, to draw
inferences and conclusions supported by the data, and communicate those insights

### Project Expectations, at minimum:
- Programming Content must have some evidence of work completed in a programming language. Other analyses might be completed in Excel/Tableau, etc
- For Data Management, project must be involved at least with one of the following:
  - Accessing data from a database
  - Merging data from various sources
  - And data cleaning
- For Visualization, project must have approximately 80% of the graphs and tables be clearly titled and labeled. The content being communicated by the visuals is mostly clear and anything that is not clear is explained by the student in the presentation
- Regarding Data Analysis, the student clearly identifies statistical questions. Analysis of the data is accurate and appropriate, but conditions are not checked. The conclusion includes a clear answer to the statistical question that is mostly consistent with the data analysis and method of data collection

### Project Overview
The data used for this project came from research conducted by researchers at Missouri University funded by the National Headache Foundation. A copy of the research, and its datasets, can be obtained at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235234092201006X or the creative commons library.
